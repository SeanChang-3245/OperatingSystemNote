* Main memory
* Secondary storage
	* Disk Access
		* Total access time = transfer time + seek time + rotational latency
		* Seek time: Move the head to destination track
		* Rotational latency: Rotate the disk to destination sector

## Caching

* Data in use copy from slower to faster storage temporarily
* Coherency & Consistency
	* Coherency (hardware)
	* Consistency (data)
	* The same data may appear in different level
